<p> what I thought: </p>
<ol>
	<li> ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
	<li> In a small back alley in Tokyo, there is a café which has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. But this coffee shop offers its customers a unique experience: the chance to travel back in time.

In Before the Coffee Gets Cold, we meet four visitors, each of whom is hoping to make use of the café’s time-travelling offer, in order to: confront the man who left them, receive a letter from their husband whose memory has been taken by early onset Alzheimer’s, to see their sister one last time, and to meet the daughter they never got the chance to know.

But the journey into the past does not come without risks: customers must sit in a particular seat, they cannot leave the café, and finally, they must return to the present before the coffee gets cold. </li>

	<li> I really liked this book. The story was so good, and I love how each short story has so much depth and thought into it. The characters seem so real, and I really understood what they were feeling. The magical element of the story is also displayed incredibly, making the world of Before the Coffee Gets Cold so vivid. This book and the sequel were great, and I would definitely recommend!</li>
